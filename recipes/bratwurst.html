        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I thought about naming this page 'Sausage' but then I read that our lovely German word has been adopted into the English language and will be understood.</p>
        <p>Depending on your dietary restrictions/preferences there are plenty of products to choose from under the Bratwurst-umbrella.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>as many sausages as you like</li>
            <li>condiments - most (?) Germans use mustard, personally I prefer ketchup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan.</li>
            <li>Throw in the sausages.</li>
            <li>Let them fry until they turn mild brown and look crispy.</li>
            <li>Serve on a plate and eat.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>If you own a proper grill, forget about the steps above. You know what to do.</strong></p>
