        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You all know what a frozen pizza is. Above you can see my former all-time favourite.
            Unfortunately they changed something about the dough recently and now all of their products are inedible.</p>
        <p>Don't be discouraged. There are plenty of other brands around you can choose from.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a frozen pizza of your choice</li>
            <li>condiments - hot sauce, ketchup, mayo (please don't)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven according to the instructions on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Put the pizza in.</li>
            <li>Wait.</li>
            <li>When ready, taket it out. Don't let it cool off for too long.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
